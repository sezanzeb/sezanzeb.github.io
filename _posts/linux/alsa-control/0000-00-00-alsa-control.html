<p>Since ALSA provides dmix for soundcards that don't support multiplexing and softvol for those that can't control their volume,
it is not necessary to run pulseaudio for that. This application creates .asoundrc default configurations for this purpose,
while the GUI may work as a replacement for pavucontrol.</p>

<p>For more information and installation instructions, see <a href="https://github.com/sezanzeb/alsa-control">alsa-control on github</a>.</p>
<p>You can also get it from the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/alsa-control/">alsa-control</a> AUR package.</p>
