<p>LDA is a widely known model that finds topics in text. But, similar to k-means, you have to decide
how many topics to look for. The stochastic nature of machine learning algorithms also causes the model
to have instabilities, which results in topics being a mixture of multiple topics. This is the issue
that led to the development of the “Ensemble LDA” model, which detects the stable topics in the text
by using an ensemble of LDA topic models. The model detects and uses topic mixtures for stabilization.</p>
